# MAC Changer

The MAC Changer is a utility designed to modify the Media Access Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a computer system.

## Introduction

A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communication on a network. The MAC Changer tool allows users to change the MAC address of their network interface, providing anonymity and security benefits by masking the original hardware address.

## Features

- **MAC Address Modification:** Change the MAC address of a network interface to a specified value.
- **Random MAC Generation:** Generate a random MAC address for the network interface.
- **Vendor-Specific MAC:** Set the MAC address to a vendor-specific value to mimic hardware from a specific manufacturer.
- **Persistence:** Apply the changes persistently across system reboots to maintain anonymity.
- **Verification:** Verify that the MAC address has been successfully changed and is being used by the network interface.

## Usage

1. **Interface Selection:** Choose the network interface whose MAC address will be changed.
2. **MAC Address Configuration:** Specify the new MAC address or choose a random or vendor-specific value.
3. **Apply Changes:** Execute the MAC Changer tool to apply the new MAC address to the selected interface.
4. **Verification:** Confirm that the MAC address has been successfully changed by checking the interface settings or using network diagnostic tools.

## Warning

Changing the MAC address of a network interface may violate network policies or terms of service agreements, and could potentially disrupt network communication or result in legal consequences. This tool should only be used responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
